      content="SaveToDrive | Upload files from URL to Cloud Services | Save any files from the Internet to Cloud Services without downloading it to your computer and re-uploading it. You can download any small, medium and big size files and within a few minutes it will be on your Cloud Services. Email notification is also available with progress report of your uploads. You can just enter the URL, pick a Cloud Service and click Save, the upload will start. Even when you close the browser tab, the file will still be uploaded in background. The upload process is from cloud to cloud therefore it is much faster. SaveToDrive is also useful for mobile users as you can remotely upload files, including file types that aren't supported by your mobile phone or tablet, to your mobile devices via Cloud Services."
